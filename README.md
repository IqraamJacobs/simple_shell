# 0x16. C - Simple Shell

This project has to be done in a team of two people. Writing a bash shell prototype is not easy task for
a beginer software engineer, but we alx students we do Hard things.
The project consists of a basic command interpreter (shell) created in C programming language, with very
little features, (other features may or may not be added to the development of the project); the
development is was part of an intensive software engineering program with ALX (In collaboration wih
Holberton School).

# SYNOPSIS
Just like all other unix like shells, The HSH shell reads commands provided by a user through Standard
Input Stream and attempts to execute them by means of low level system procedures. This is done by using
built in functions, or searching for executable programs in the operating system.

The shell has two operating modes:
**Interactive** and **Non-interactive**

In **Interactive mode**, the shell displays a prompt indicating that the user can write and execute a
command. After the command is run, the prompt will appear again a wait for a new command. This can go
indefinitely as long as the user does not exit the shell.

In **Non-interactive mode**, the shell will need to be run with a command input piped into its execution
so that the command is run as soon as the shell starts. In this mode no prompt will appear, and no
input will be expected from the user.

In both modes, commands can be written with their absolute path or simply their executable name if they
exist in one of the folders defined by the environmental variable PATH or as built in functions of the
shell.

This readme would be updated.
